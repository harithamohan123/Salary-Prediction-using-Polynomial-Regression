# Salary-Prediction-using-Polynomial-Regression
__________________________________________________

In this project, we use Polynomial Regression to predict the  salary of an employee based on level of experience.

Procedure:
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.
=> Collect dataset of salary with experience , it has only one input(experience) and one output(salary).
=> Load dataset and summarize detials such as number of rows and columns.
=> Segregate the independant and dependant values.
=> Use polynomial regression algorithm by :
                           => converting normal feature x into polynomial format
                           => Training Linear regression using polynomial format featured x
                           => Visualise polynomial regression result
=> Training model for dataset.
=> Predict model with fit_transform.
